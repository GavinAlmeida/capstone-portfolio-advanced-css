        <h2>Hi.</h2>
        <p>I am a developer and engineer. I'm also a realtor on the side.
           I build websites and also build company networks.
           I specialize in front-end work as I love the creative side of tech.
           I am also very active and love going to the gym, walking, hiking, basketball, and boxing!
           I also love my gaming time.
        </p>

        <h2>Skills</h2>
        <h3>UI and UX Design</h3>
        <p>One of my favorite parts of web design as a whole is UI-UX. Creativity is key, setting up the user interface is what got me started with web development. My goal one day is to work for netflix as a UI-UX designer. I have two years of experience setting up layouts and making them functional as well as appealing to the eye.</p>

        </div>
        <h3>HTML and CSS</h3>
        <p>HTML has an organizational quality to it that makes it really fun to work with. I love CSS styling particularly as I love the creative aspect of it. I have over two years of HTML and CSS experience.</p>
        <div class="coding-div">

        </div>
        <h3>Programming Languages: JavaScript and Python</h3>
        <p>JavaScript is the backbone of functionaity for my web development projects. I have worked with JavaScript for the past two years. Python is my favorite language as it is simplistic but can get a lot of things done. It is very versatile and I have worked with it on game development projects here and there and scripts for servers and administrative activities. I have two years of experience with python as well.</p>

        <h3>Eating food...lots of food...id be fat if i didnt work out lol <br> on a serious note, Network Engineering and Cybersecurity</h3>
        <p>My favorite food is steak, anyway networking is a very interesting but difficult thing to master, I have been working with computer networking for the past three years and I am on my way to getting my CCNA - Cisco Certified Networking Associate. I also have the Azure Certified Expert Certification - AZ-305. Cybersecurity is a must in the tech world. The past three years I have been learning and working within the cybersecurity space as I have the Azure Security Engineer Associate Certification from Microsoft - AZ-500.</p>
